# brewery-finder  
## What is this?  
A webapp that uses a public API to find breweries based in Ireland, UK and USA. I also added an external link to Google Maps for all the items provided with longitude and latitude.  
## How did I make it?  
I stored the input given (city name) in a variable and passed the variable in an async function to get datas, stored them and used a map function to create the html code. .
